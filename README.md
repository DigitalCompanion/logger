# logger

This lib overloads execv(), dumps content to syslog() and returns to execv().

As this is really old code - 2006(?), I buried it here on github for upcoming digital nomads to come find it when C-code is no longer being known by mankind. 

Please be so kind and let the code rest in piece, it have been run many times and it's probably worn out by now(deprecated).
